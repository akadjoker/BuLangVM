## ⚡ Key Features

### 🔥 High Performance VM
- Stack‑based bytecode virtual machine
- Optimized instruction dispatch
- Minimal allocations at runtime
- Predictable execution cost

### 🧠 Designed for Game Development
- Native **Raylib** integration
- Frame‑based execution (`frame` keyword)
- Cooperative multitasking with **processes** and **fibers**
- Perfect for update loops, AI, animations, and gameplay logic

### 🧵 Fibers & Processes
- Run **tens of thousands** of concurrent tasks
- No OS threads, no locks, no context‑switch overhead
- Deterministic scheduling

```bulang
process enemy() {
    while (true) {
        move();
        frame;
    }
}
```

### 🧱 Object‑Oriented Programming
- Classes with inheritance
- Structs for lightweight data
- Method chaining support

```bulang
class Player {
    def init(name, hp) {
        self.name = name;
        self.hp = hp;
    }
}
```

### 📦 Arrays, Maps & Built‑in Types
- Dynamic arrays and hash maps
- Python‑style indexing (including negative indexes)
- Rich built‑in methods (`push`, `pop`, `len`, `keys`, etc.)

### 🔄 Control Flow Power
- `if / elif / else`
- `for`, `while`, `do‑while`
- `switch` (no fallthrough)
- `break` / `continue`
- Low‑level `goto` and `gosub` for state machines

---

## 🧹 Optional Garbage Collector (New)

BuLang now includes a **simple mark‑and‑sweep garbage collector**, designed specifically for real‑time applications:

- ✔ Can be **enabled or disabled**
- ✔ Can be **triggered manually**
- ✔ Avoids unexpected frame spikes
- ✔ Perfect for games and simulations

This allows developers to **control exactly when memory cleanup happens**, preventing stutters during gameplay.

---

## 🧩 Native Module System

BuLang features a **zero‑overhead native module system**:

- Compile‑time resolution of native calls
- No string lookups at runtime
- Tree‑shaking: only used functions are registered
- Supports `import` (namespaced) and `using` (flat)

```bulang
import raylib;
using raylib;

InitWindow(800, 600, "BuLang Game");
```


### 📚 Easy to Learn
Clean syntax, comprehensive documentation, interactive playground, and working game examples to learn from.
